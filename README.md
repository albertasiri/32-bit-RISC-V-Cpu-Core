# Making a RISC-V CPU Core
This repository is a part of Eklavya Mentorship programme by SRA Vjti and contains all the information to build a pipelined CPU Core
## Table of Contents
* **What is RISC-V ISA?**
RISC-V(Reduced Instruction Set Architecture) is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA)
based on established reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. Unlike most other ISA
designs, the RISC-V ISA is provided under open source licenses that do not require fees to use.
* **Project Overview**
This project focuses on making a RISC-V CPU Core using logisim software and with the help of
EdX course by Steeve Hoover who has worked on the open-source silicon ecosystem through
numerous technologies including the WARP-V CPU core generator with support for RISC-V.
RISC-V is significant because it will allow smaller device manufacturers to build hardware
without paying royalties and allow developers and researchers to design and experiment with a
proven and freely available instruction set architecture. RISC-V is ideal for a variety of
applications from IOTs to Embedded systems such as disks, CPUs, Calculators, SOCs, etc.

To build our CPU Core, we need to assemble 6 components mainly:
● PC logic
● Register File
● IMem
● DMem
● ALU
● Decode Logic
